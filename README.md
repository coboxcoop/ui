### Repo Process
We're following the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Please base off of `develop` when working on `feature/<feature_name>` branches. This should be a branch per feature.

#### Example
A complete example demonstrating a Feature Branch Flow is as follows. Assuming we have a repo setup with a master branch.
```
git checkout master
git checkout -b develop
git checkout -b feature_branch
# work happens on feature branch
git checkout develop
git merge feature_branch
git checkout master
git merge develop
git branch -d feature_branch
```
